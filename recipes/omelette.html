    <h2>Vegetarian Omelette, an easy and fast recipe</h2>
    <p>Omelettes are so easy to make and only require a few inexpensive ingredients, but, of course, 
        you can adapt this recipe to your own taste.</p>
    <p>It might not be as easy to flip it over, and the omelette is likely to stick to the pan though, 
        so make sure you add plenty of butter, and perhaps less vegetables, to make the omelette lighter.</p>
    <p>
       Making an omelette is super easy, but you need ONE GOOD NON-STICK PAN if you want your omelette to look good, 
       and not like scrambled eggs. <br />Moreover, always grease the pan, whether with oil or butter, just a small amount would do, 
       otherwise it will stick to the pan big time.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/4 red pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Cheddar cheese, grated</li>
        <li>a few leaves of fresh baby spinach</li>
        <li>2 cherry tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the cherry tomatoes, red pepper and spinach leaves.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in the frying pan.</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs with a fork and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Add the mixture to the pan and spread it out evenly. When it starts to firm up, but still has a bit of raw on top, 
            add grated cheese and also the cherry tomatoes, spinach, and red pepper.</li>
        <li>Using a spatula, ease the edges and quickly turn it over onto the other side.</li>
        <li>The other side will cook a lot quicker, it only needs about 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>When it is done, place a large plate on top of the pan and flip the omelette as fast as you can.</li>
    </ol>
