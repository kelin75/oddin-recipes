        <h2>These waffles turn out lovely and crispy. Perfect for any day of the week!</h2>
        <p>Step away from your freezer: These easy, from-scratch waffles are so simple, you'll want to make them every weekend (maybe even on weekdays, too). 
            You won't find any fussy steps or unexpected ingredients in our recipe, which means you can whip up these breakfast favorites whenever your cravings hit. </p>
        <p>
            All you need to make our crispy waffles are ingredients you likely already have in your kitchen: 
            all-purpose flour, sugar, baking powder, butter, milk, and eggs. 
            Combine the dry ingredients in one bowl, the wet ingredients in another, then add the wet to the dry and mix together—that's it! 
            So long as you preheated your waffle iron and have plenty of butter and maple syrup on hand for serving, 
            breakfast will be the best meal of the day, guaranteed.
